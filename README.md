# UnrealEngineProject2

This is my second project I undertook on Unreal Engine - first person shooter game.

This is by no means a new project, but learnt from a fabulous teacher Fahir on his AwesomeTuts channel.

Also, it should not give you the wrong idea that it is a copy-and-paste work. I had to thoroughly put in the hours to actually learn the mechanics and process behind game development.

I would also like to add upon it that, the project was made as a combination of both coding and using blueprints.
